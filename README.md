# Byte Reverser :floppy_disk:
Python script to reverse bytes in files.

## Usage :wrench:
To launch script, run:

**`python byte_reverser.py "file_name_arguments"...`**

Alternatively, you can click and drag any number of files onto the **`run_byte_reverser.bat`** file to 
reverse all selected files (under the condition that the .bat file is in the same directory as the 
**`byte_reverser.py`** script).

**Note:** The script supports any number of files as arguments.

## Purpose :question:
Where I work has a strong firewall which automatically scans - and blocks - any outgoing emails which
have attachments of which match certain byte patterns. This project was created with the purpose of 
ensuring that files do not match the security pattern and therefore enables me to email files to myself
from work.
